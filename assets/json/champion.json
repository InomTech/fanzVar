Meanwhile South Africa and Zambia provided plenty of free-flowing football only to be let down by poor finishing. South Africa arrived in Egypt with just 12 players and lacked six of the 21-man squad when they faced Zambia due to some domestic clubs taking a hard line on releasing players. The eventual finalists and the winners of the third-place play-off will represent Africa at the 16-nation Tokyo Olympics football tournament.",

They have most of, if not all the stars from around the world playing in the European leagues, so of course they attract more people. The solution is simple. If the club's stadia is not up to scratch then the club should be disqualifed, if the club doesn't have the funds to participate, then they should be disqualified. Caf needs to set the bar so that only the good teams get to play. It's time to start being more Professional. And of course Caf should do a better job of finding sponsors and increase the prize money.",

The necessary infrastructure must also be put in place either by the clubs or with support from their respective govrnments. Caf must also increase the prize money for the participating clubs and also support the National Associations in the organisation of the various domestic league competitions so that worthy champions may emerge from the domestic leagues to compete in the Caf competition.",
